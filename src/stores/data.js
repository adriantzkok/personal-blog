export const about_me = `I recently graduated from the University of Toronto with a degree in Management and International Business. Although I was born and raised in Toronto, I took the opportunity to travel as the pandemic ended and completed a four-month exchange semester at Singapore Management University in Singapore, studying Quantitative Finance and Banking. 

After, I completed another exchange semester at National Taiwan University, studying Chinese. Now, I am currently in Hong Kong working in the consulting industry! I hope to share my experience and what I have learned in this website! Hopefully people who wish to follow a similar path can benefit greatly from my sharings.`
